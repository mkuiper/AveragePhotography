## AveragePhotography                        Feb 2018

This project is designed to run averaged timelapse photography
on a Raspberry pi with either a picam module or webcam.  

Regular timelapse usually strings together a series of sequential 
images to make a movie. Averaged timelapse photography differs by
averaging a series of images which are then used to make the 
timelapse movie. With the additional averaging step, many moving
objects such as cars and pedestrians disappear from the scene. 

There are a number of bash scripts in this directory whcih control 
the capturing of the timelapse sequence. They are designed to be
run using a crontab so that they automatically launch at various 
times of the day.
